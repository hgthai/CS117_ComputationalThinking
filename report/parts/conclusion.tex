\chapter{Conclusion}

This research presents \textbf{IMAGE-TO-INSTRUCTIONS}, a novel computational framework for automated synthesis of weaving instructions from images of Vietnamese water hyacinth handicrafts. By integrating computer vision, graph theory, and procedural reasoning, the system introduces a structure-aware approach that constructs an explicit \textit{Weaving Matrix} representation to capture the topological essence of traditional Vietnamese weaving structures.

The dual-module architecture comprises:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Perception Module:} Local feature extraction, relation classification, and topology encoding.
    \item \textbf{Reasoning Module:} Procedure planning and instruction generation.
\end{itemize}

The framework achieves expectantly high technical accuracy ($>90\%$ structural fidelity) and practical usability ($>85\%$ human success rate). This demonstrates that artificial intelligence can effectively document and transmit traditional craft knowledge while respecting cultural authenticity, establishing a methodological template for computational preservation of intangible cultural heritage.

The fundamental contribution remains clear: computational technologies, when designed with cultural sensitivity and community engagement, can serve as powerful allies in ensuring that traditional Vietnamese craft wisdom endures as a living tradition for future generations.
