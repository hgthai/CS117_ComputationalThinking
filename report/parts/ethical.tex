\section{Ethical \& Social Impacts}

This project extends beyond technical implementation to address significant cultural and social values, particularly in the context of preserving traditional Vietnamese craftsmanship.

\subsection{Cultural Preservation}
The system supports the digitization and preservation of traditional craft knowledge. By converting physical weaving patterns into digital data and explicit instructions, the project helps prevent the loss of traditional water hyacinth weaving techniques, ensuring this knowledge remains accessible to future generations.

\subsection{Human-Centered Design}
The technology is designed to \textit{assist} rather than \textit{replace} artisans.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Artisans:} The system serves as a documentation tool, helping them record and archive their creative patterns.
    \item \textbf{For Learners:} It provides visual and textual guides, shortening the learning curve and making weaving techniques more approachable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Knowledge Ownership}
The research team is acutely aware of intellectual property and data ethics. Care must be taken to respect local communities and avoid unauthorized exploitation of traditional patterns. The usage of weaving designs must ensure transparency and proper attribution of indigenous knowledge.
